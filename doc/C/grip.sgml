  <chapter id="intro">
    <title>Introduction.</title> <para>Grip is a gtk-based cd-player and
    cd-ripper. It has the ripping capabilities of cdparanoia builtin, but
    can also use external rippers (such as cdda2wav). It also provides an
    automated frontend for MP3 encoders, letting you take a disc and
    transform it easily straight into MP3s. The DiscDB protocol is supported
    for retrieving track information from disc database servers. Grip works
    with DigitalDJ to provide a unified "computerized" version of your music
    collection.</para>

  <chapter id="cdplayer">
    <title>Playing CDs with Grip</title> 
    <para>Grip functions as a full-featured CD player, as can be seen in
    <xref linkend="cdplayerfull">. Tracks can be selected by clicking on
    them with the left mouse button. Double-clicking will select the track,
    and begin playing it.</para>

      <para>Any of the '%' switches can optionally be preceded by a '*' (for

	when the switch is being used in something other than a
	filename.</para>

    <title>First Asked Questions</title>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Q: When I try to rip a track, I get X I/O errors. What
	  gives?</para>
	
	<para>A: This seems to be a problem with non-thread-safe
	  systems. Make sure your system is safe for threads. This often
	  seems to be associated with libc5.</para></listitem>
      
      
      <listitem><para>Q: I just get a message saying that the program can't
	  access my drive. This makes it hard to do much. Help!</para>
	
	<para>A: Your user account must have access to the cdrom device.
	</para></listitem>
      
      
      <listitem><para>Q: I can play cd's fine, but my ripper can't access
	  the drive. Why not?</para>
	
	<para>A: On scsi systems, rippers (cdparanoia, at least) need access
	  to the generic scsi device as well.</para></listitem>
      
      
      <listitem><para>Q: The progress bar doesn't seem to be completely
	  accurate when doing an MP3 encode. Why can't it get it
	  right?</para>
	
	<para>A: The progress bar is done based on the size of the output
	  file. If you have the kbits/sec set properly, Grip should estimate
	  the size properly. Note that if you use variable bitrate encoding
	  (supported by encoders like LAME and xing) Grip has no way to
	  accurately guess the file size.</para></listitem>
      
      <listitem><para>Q: When I encode tracks, the MP3 progress bar never
	  does anything. What happened to progress?</para>
	
	<para>A: If your MP3 encoder doesn't accept an output filename (like
	  BladeEnc), or you haven't passed it one on the command-line, then
	  it might not be outputting to the file Grip expects. Make sure
	  that your MP3 file format is set to what your encoder is actually
	  producing.</para></listitem>
      
      
      <listitem><para>Q: When Grip looks up disc information, it works, but
	  says "Error saving disc data". Why?</para>
	
	<para>A: Grip saves local copies of disc track information in the
	  directory "~/.cddb". It must be able to create or access this
	  directory.</para></listitem>
      
      
      <listitem><para>Q: How come I don't get any scrollbars in the track
	  display?</para>
	
	<para>A: You are using a version of Grip compiled for gtk+ v1.0.x on
	  a system that has gtk+ v1.2.x installed. You need to either get a
	  binary compiled for the development series of gtk+, or compile
	  Grip yourself.</para></listitem>
      
      
      <listitem><para>Q: When my buddy runs Grip, he gets those nifty LCD
	  icons showing rip/encode/CDDB status, but I don't. What makes him
	  so special?</para>
	
	<para>A: He's using a more recent version of gtk+ than you are. Due
	  to bugs in gtk+ v1.0.x, I don't support the icons under
	  it. Upgrade your gtk+!</para></listitem>
      
      
      <listitem><para>Q: I can't get Grip to rip any tracks! This makes it
	  less than useful...</para>
	
	<para>A: Grip won't rip tracks unless you tell it what to rip. Use
	  the right mouse button to select tracks for
	  ripping.</para></listitem>
      
      
      <listitem><para>Q: I was listening to a CD in Grip and it sounded
	  horrible! What's up?</para>
	
	<para>A: Perhaps you are listening to country
	music...</para></listitem>

  <chapter id="cddb">
    <title>CDDB notes</title> <para>I have declined to sign a license
      agreement with Escient, the company who owns "www.cddb.com" and runs
      the CDDB server "us.cddb.com". Their license would (among other
      things) have required me to place advertisements in Grip and restrict
      you, the user, to use only their databases. I am against this
      commercial use of the track information submitted by users such as
      yourself. For this reason, I encourage you to use free servers, such
      as freedb.org.</para>
